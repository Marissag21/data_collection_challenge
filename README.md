# data_collection_challenge

I used automated browsing to visit the Mars news site.
Then created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to extract the titles and the preview text of the news articles. 
I then stored these elements in a python dictionary.

# Part 2

I used automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
Then I created a Beautiful Soup object to scrape the table.
Next, I changed the data types of the columns to the data type they were associated with. 
After this, I wrote code to get the amount of months that exist in Mars, how many Martian days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset, what are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars, then I plotted the results in a bar chart for the coldest/warmest months. I also analyzed the data fro the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars, and then plotted the results as well. 
I then used datetime to find out how many Earth days exist in a Martian year.
